## My first blog post - building and learning in public
Hey everyone, welcome to my first blog post!

I have been wanting to start a blog on my learnings since embarking on my software engineering journey (since 2+ years ago). I am very stoked to be finally doing this!

 Ever since reading this amazing article: [Don't end the week with nothing](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/do-not-end-the-week-with-nothing), I personally believe that having such a space allows me to:

1. Showcase and document my learnings along the way
2. Build some social proof/ demonstrate the my experiences which cannot be shown in OSS projects
3. Share my solutions for problems I've encountered, hopefully helping someone along the way


With that, I hope you will enjoy my posts!
