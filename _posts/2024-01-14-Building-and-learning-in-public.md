## Building and learning in public
Hey everyone, welcome to my so called first blog post!

I have been wanting to start a blog on my learnings since embarking on my software engineering journey (since 2+ years ago). I am very stoked to be finally doing this!

Technically this is not (in chronological sense) my first blog post as I have been saving alot of my writings in notions for my personal consumption.

But ever since reading this amazing article: [Don't end the week with nothing](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/do-not-end-the-week-with-nothing), I personally believe that having such a space allows me to:

1. Showcase and document my learnings along the way
2. Build some social proof/ demonstrate the my experiences which cannot be shown in OSS projects
3. Share my solutions for problems I've encountered, hopefully helping someone along the way


With that, I will be transferring alot of the things I've written in the past to this blog (naturally back dating them).

I welcome anyone to leave any comments (when I've figured out how to set up a comments section) and have enjoy your time here!

Alternatively, feel free to drop me an email or find me on linkedin if you have any questions or comments. Cheers!
