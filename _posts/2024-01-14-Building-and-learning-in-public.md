## My first blog post - building and learning in public
Hey everyone, welcome to my first blog post!

I have been wanting to start a blog on my learnings since embarking on my software engineering journey (since 2+ years ago). I am very stoked to be finally doing this!

It would be a way for me to document what I've learnt along the way, and serve as an avenue for me to reflect upon my growth as a software engineer.

In particular I also strongly believe in the concept of building (and learning) in public. As expounded in this great article: [Don't end the week with nothing](https://training.kalzumeus.com/newsletters/archive/do-not-end-the-week-with-nothing), I personally believe that having such a space allows me to:

1. Showcase and document my learnings along the way
2. Build some social proof/ demonstrate the my experiences which cannot be shown in OSS projects
3. Share my solutions for problems I've encountered, hopefully helping someone along the way


With that, I hope you will enjoy my posts!
